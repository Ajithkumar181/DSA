Sure Ajith! Here's a complete **revision note with dry run** for the problem:

## 📘 Problem: **Longest Consecutive Sequence**

---

### ✅ Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the **longest sequence of consecutive numbers**.

You must solve it in **O(n log n)** time or better.

---

### 🔍 Example:

#### Input:

```cpp
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

#### Output:

```
4 → The sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## 🧠 Approach (Using Sorting)

### ✨ Idea:

1. Sort the array → so that consecutive numbers are next to each other.
2. Skip duplicates.
3. Count lengths of increasing consecutive subsequences.

---

### ⚙️ Code Logic (Step-by-step)

```cpp
sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

int lastsmall = INT_MIN;
int count = 0;
int longest = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (nums[i] - 1 == lastsmall) {
        // consecutive number
        count++;
    } else if (nums[i] != lastsmall) {
        // reset count (new start)
        count = 1;
    }
    lastsmall = nums[i];
    longest = max(longest, count);
}
```

## 🧪 Dry Run

### Input:

```cpp
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

### Step 1: Sort

```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 100, 200]
```

### Variables:

* `lastsmall = INT_MIN`
* `count = 0`
* `longest = 0`

---

### Iteration Table:

| i | nums\[i] | lastsmall | nums\[i]-1 == lastsmall? | Action                     | count | longest |
| - | -------- | --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----- | ------- |
| 0 | 1        | INT\_MIN  | ❌                        | count = 1, lastsmall = 1   | 1     | 1       |
| 1 | 2        | 1         | ✅                        | count++, lastsmall = 2     | 2     | 2       |
| 2 | 3        | 2         | ✅                        | count++, lastsmall = 3     | 3     | 3       |
| 3 | 4        | 3         | ✅                        | count++, lastsmall = 4     | 4     | 4       |
| 4 | 100      | 4         | ❌                        | count = 1, lastsmall = 100 | 1     | 4       |
| 5 | 200      | 100       | ❌                        | count = 1, lastsmall = 200 | 1     | 4       |

✅ Final Answer: `4`

---

## ⛔ Edge Cases:

* Empty array → output = 0
* Duplicates → skip them
* All elements the same → output = 1

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept              | Explanation                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Consecutive sequence | Numbers like `n, n+1, n+2...`              |
| Sorting              | Helps bring them next to each other        |
| lastsmall            | Keeps track of the last number in sequence |
| count                | Counts current sequence length             |
| longest              | Stores the maximum length seen             |

---

## ✅ Final Code (Cleaned)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int lastsmall = INT_MIN;
        int longest = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - 1 == lastsmall) {
                count++;
            } else if (nums[i] != lastsmall) {
                count = 1;
            }
            lastsmall = nums[i];
            longest = max(longest, count);
        }
        return longest;
    }
};
```

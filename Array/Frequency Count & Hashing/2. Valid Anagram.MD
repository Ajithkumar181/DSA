Sure Ajith! Here's a clean and simple **revision note** with explanation, dry run, and concept breakdown for the `isAnagram` function.

## 📘 Revision Notes: **Check if Two Strings Are Anagrams**

### ✅ Problem Statement:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

---

### 💡 What is an Anagram?

* Two strings are **anagrams** if:

  * They have **exactly the same letters**
  * With the **same frequency**
  * Order **doesn't matter**

#### Examples:

* `"listen"` and `"silent"` → ✅ Anagram
* `"aabb"` and `"baba"` → ✅ Anagram
* `"aabb"` and `"ab"` → ❌ Not an Anagram

---

### ⚙️ Logic Behind the Code:

```cpp
vector<int> freq(26, 0);
```

* Creates a frequency array of size 26 (for each letter a–z).

```cpp
for(char& c : s) freq[c - 'a']++;
for(char& c : t) freq[c - 'a']--;
```

* Increase count for every char in `s`
* Decrease count for every char in `t`

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    if(freq[i] != 0)
        return false;
```

* If counts aren't zero, strings differ → not anagrams

## 🧪 Dry Run Example

### Input:

```cpp
s = "listen", t = "silent"
```

### Step 1: Frequency Array Initialization

```cpp
freq = [0, 0, ..., 0] // size = 26
```

### Step 2: Count characters in `s = "listen"`

| Character | Index | freq\[index] |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 'l'       | 11    | +1           |
| 'i'       | 8     | +1           |
| 's'       | 18    | +1           |
| 't'       | 19    | +1           |
| 'e'       | 4     | +1           |
| 'n'       | 13    | +1           |

```cpp
freq = [..., 1@4, 1@8, 1@11, 1@13, 1@18, 1@19, ...]
```

### Step 3: Subtract characters from `t = "silent"`

| Character | Index | freq\[index] |
| --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 's'       | 18    | -1 → 0       |
| 'i'       | 8     | -1 → 0       |
| 'l'       | 11    | -1 → 0       |
| 'e'       | 4     | -1 → 0       |
| 'n'       | 13    | -1 → 0       |
| 't'       | 19    | -1 → 0       |

### Step 4: Check all 26 elements in `freq`

```cpp
All are 0 → return true
```

✔️ Output: `true`

---

## 🔁 What if strings are not anagrams?

### Input:

```cpp
s = "aabb", t = "ab"
```

* `s` adds: a → +2, b → +2
* `t` subtracts: a → -1, b → -1
  → `freq = [1, 1, 0, ...]` → Not all zero → ❌

✔️ Output: `false`

## 🧠 Summary

| Concept          | Description                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Frequency Array  | 26-size array for a–z characters  |
| Step 1           | Add counts from string `s`        |
| Step 2           | Subtract counts using string `t`  |
| Step 3           | If all counts are zero → anagram  |
| Time Complexity  | O(n) where `n = length of s or t` |
| Space Complexity | O(1) — constant array size        |

Let me know if you'd like to see:

* A **Unicode-safe** version for all characters (not just a–z)
* A version using `unordered_map` instead of array
* Or questions to practice this concept?

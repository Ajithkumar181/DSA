Here are your **revision notes** with a clear **dry run** for:

---

# ✅ LeetCode 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

---

## 🔸 Problem Summary:

You are given:

* A string `s` of uppercase letters (A–Z)
* An integer `k` representing the **maximum number of characters you can replace**

🧠 Goal: Find the **length of the longest substring** where you can **replace at most `k` characters** to make all characters **the same**.

---

## 📘 Example:

### Input:

```
s = "AABABBA"
k = 1
```

### Output:

```
4
```

### Explanation:

We can replace one `'A'` to `'B'` in `"ABBA"` or `"BABB"` to make `"BBBB"` — length = 4.

---

## 🔧 Key Concepts:

### ✅ Sliding Window Technique

* Maintain a window `[left, right]` in the string
* Track:

  * `freq[26]`: Frequency of characters in window
  * `maxFreq`: Max frequency of any character in window
* Valid Window Condition:

  ```
  window size - maxFreq ≤ k
  ```

  → Only `k` characters need to be replaced

---

## ✅ Final Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        int left = 0, maxFreq = 0, maxLen = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.size(); ++right) {
            freq[s[right] - 'A']++;
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq[s[right] - 'A']);

            int windowSize = right - left + 1;

            if (windowSize - maxFreq > k) {
                freq[s[left] - 'A']--;
                left++;
            }

            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

## 🧠 Key Insight:

* The trick is to always maintain the window such that we never need to replace more than `k` characters.
* `maxFreq` is **not recomputed** when left moves — this is acceptable because the window still works correctly.
* The result is tracked using `maxLen`.

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity:

| Complexity | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| ⏱️ Time    | O(n)  |
| 🧠 Space   | O(1)  |

Why? Only 26 uppercase letters → `freq[26]`.

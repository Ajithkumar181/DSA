Here's a **revision note with dry run** for your `twoSum` function using the **two-pointer technique**.

## ✅ Problem: Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers, added by 1 (1-based indexing).

## 💡 Approach: Two Pointer Technique

### 🔸 Why Two Pointers?

The array is sorted, so we can use two pointers:

* One from the **start** (`i = 0`)
* One from the **end** (`j = numbers.size() - 1`)

At each step:

* Calculate `sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j]`
* If `sum == target`, return `i+1` and `j+1`
* If `sum > target`, move `j` left
* If `sum < target`, move `i` right

## 🔁 Dry Run

### 🧪 Input:

```cpp
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

### ▶ Steps:

| i | j | numbers\[i] | numbers\[j] | sum | Action                |
| - | - | ----------- | ----------- | --- | --------------------- |
| 0 | 3 | 2           | 15          | 17  | sum > target → j--    |
| 0 | 2 | 2           | 11          | 13  | sum > target → j--    |
| 0 | 1 | 2           | 7           | 9   | ✅ Found! Return (1,2) |

### ✅ Output:

```cpp
[1, 2]
```

## 📘 Time and Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Time       | O(n)  |
| Space      | O(1)  |

## 🔚 Final Code

```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = numbers.size() - 1;

    while (i < j) {
        int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
        if (sum == target) {
            return {i + 1, j + 1};  // 1-based indexing
        } else if (sum > target) {
            j--;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }

    return {-1, -1}; // Shouldn't reach here if one solution is guaranteed
}
```

Let me know if you want dry run for a different input or want to convert this to Python.

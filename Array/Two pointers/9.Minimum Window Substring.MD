Here are concise **revision notes** on the **Two Pointers** technique using the LeetCode **76. Minimum Window Substring** problem as a base reference:

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Summary:

**Goal:** Find the smallest substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t` (including duplicates).
If no such substring exists, return `""`.

---

## üß† Concept Used: **Two Pointers + Sliding Window + Hash Map**

### Key Ideas:

* **Two pointers** (`left` and `right`) define a **window** in string `s`.
* **Hash map** tracks frequency of characters in string `t`.
* As the `right` pointer expands, we check if the current window contains all characters from `t`.
* Once it does, **shrink** the window from the `left` to find the minimum length.

---

## üîÅ Algorithm (O(m + n)):

### Step-by-Step:

1. Count frequency of all characters in `t` using a hashmap (or array of size 128 for ASCII).
2. Initialize:

   * `left`, `right` pointers = 0.
   * `count = t.length()` ‚Üí total characters to match.
   * `minLen = INT_MAX`, `start = 0` to track the best window.
3. Move `right` pointer:

   * Decrease frequency of `s[right]` in map.
   * If it's still >= 0, we matched a needed char ‚Üí decrement `count`.
4. When `count == 0` (valid window):

   * Update `minLen` and `start` if this window is smaller.
   * Try to move `left` to minimize window.
   * If `s[left]` becomes a needed char again, increase `count`.

## ‚úÖ Code (C++) ‚Äì Clean Two Pointers

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        if (s.length() < t.length()) return "";

        vector<int> target(128, 0); // ASCII character count

        for (char c : t) target[c]++;

        int left = 0, right = 0, count = t.size();
        int minLen = INT_MAX, start = 0;

        while (right < s.size()) {
            if (target[s[right]] > 0) count--;
            target[s[right]]--;
            right++;

            while (count == 0) {
                if (right - left < minLen) {
                    minLen = right - left;
                    start = left;
                }

                target[s[left]]++;
                if (target[s[left]] > 0) count++;
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minLen == INT_MAX ? "" : s.substr(start, minLen);
    }
};
```

## üîç Dry Run Example

**Input:** `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"`, `t = "ABC"`
**Steps:**

* Target freq: A=1, B=1, C=1
* Start with window \[0, 0], expand until it contains A, B, C ‚Üí found "ADOBEC"
* Shrink left ‚Üí better window found at "BANC"
* No better found ‚Üí return "BANC"

## ‚è± Time and Space Complexity

| Aspect | Value                 |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Time   | O(m + n)              |
| Space  | O(1) (128 chars only) |

---

## üß© When to Use Two Pointers:

* When the problem involves substrings/subarrays.
* When you want to **expand and shrink** a window dynamically.
* When you‚Äôre tracking **minimum/maximum length** of a window.

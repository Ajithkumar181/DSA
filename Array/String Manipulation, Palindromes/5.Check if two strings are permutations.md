Here are the **revision notes** and a **dry run** for the classic interview problem:

---

## ✅ **Problem Statement**

**"Check if two strings are permutations of each other."**
That is, return `true` if both strings contain the exact same characters with the same frequency (but possibly in a different order).

---

## ✅ **Key Concepts**

* **Permutation** means rearrangement — same characters and same frequency.
* Examples:

  * `"listen"` and `"silent"` → ✅ Yes
  * `"triangle"` and `"integral"` → ✅ Yes
  * `"apple"` and `"pale"` → ❌ No

---

## ✅ **Approach 1: Sorting**

**Steps:**

1. If lengths differ → return `false`
2. Sort both strings
3. Compare if sorted strings are equal

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1) (if in-place sorting)

---

## ✅ **Approach 2: Frequency Count using Hash Map / Array**

### For lowercase English letters (a–z), use array of size 26

**Steps:**

1. If lengths differ → return `false`
2. Create a `count` array of size 26 initialized to 0
3. For each character in string1 → increment count
4. For each character in string2 → decrement count
5. After both loops, check if all values in count are 0

**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

---

## ✅ **Code (Approach 2 – C++)**

```cpp
bool arePermutation(string s1, string s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length())
        return false;

    int count[26] = {0};

    for (char c : s1)
        count[c - 'a']++;

    for (char c : s2)
        count[c - 'a']--;

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count[i] != 0)
            return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

---

## ✅ **Dry Run**

Let’s take `s1 = "listen"` and `s2 = "silent"`

### Step 1:

Length check:

* `len(s1) = 6`
* `len(s2) = 6` → ✅ continue

### Step 2: Count frequency from `s1`

```
count['l'-'a']++; → count[11] = 1  
count['i'-'a']++; → count[8] = 1  
count['s'-'a']++; → count[18] = 1  
count['t'-'a']++; → count[19] = 1  
count['e'-'a']++; → count[4] = 1  
count['n'-'a']++; → count[13] = 1  
```

### Step 3: Subtract frequency from `s2`

```
count['s'-'a']--; → count[18] = 0  
count['i'-'a']--; → count[8] = 0  
count['l'-'a']--; → count[11] = 0  
count['e'-'a']--; → count[4] = 0  
count['n'-'a']--; → count[13] = 0  
count['t'-'a']--; → count[19] = 0  
```

### Step 4: Check all values in count

All are 0 → ✅ return **true**

---

## ✅ **Common Interview Follow-Ups**

* Case sensitivity? ("God" vs "dog")
* Unicode characters?
* What if string contains digits or punctuation?

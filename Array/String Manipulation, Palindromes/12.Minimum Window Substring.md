Here's your **revision notes** with a **dry run** for the sliding window solution to the **Minimum Window Substring** problem using `unordered_map`.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement:

Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the **minimum window in `s`** that contains all the characters in `t` (including duplicates).
If there is no such window, return `""`.

---

## ‚úÖ Core Idea:

Use a **sliding window** and two hash maps:

* `freq1` ‚Üí frequency of characters in string `t`
* `window` ‚Üí frequency of characters in current window of `s`

We expand the window with `j`, and try to **contract** it from the left with `i` while it still satisfies the condition.

## ‚úÖ Key Variables

| Variable   | Meaning                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `freq1`    | Frequency of each character in `t`                 |
| `window`   | Frequency of characters in current window `[i, j]` |
| `required` | Number of unique chars we must match               |
| `need`     | Number of unique chars currently matched in window |
| `cnt`      | Length of smallest valid window found              |
| `start`    | Start index of that smallest window                |

---

## ‚úÖ Code Flow Summary

1. Build `freq1` from string `t`
2. Slide `j` from 0 to end of `s`

   * Add `s[j]` to `window`
   * If `window[ch] == freq1[ch]`, increment `need`
3. While `need == required` (window is valid)

   * Try to shrink from the left (`i`) to find smaller valid window
   * Update `cnt` and `start` if current window is smallest
   * Remove `s[i]` from window, and update `need` if needed

---

## ‚úÖ Dry Run

### Input:

```cpp
s = "ADOBECODEBANC"
t = "ABC"
```

### Step-by-step:

* `freq1 = {A:1, B:1, C:1}`
* Start with `i=0, j=0`

Expand:

* `j=0` ‚Üí A ‚Üí match A ‚Üí `need=1`
* `j=1` ‚Üí D ‚Üí not in t
* `j=2` ‚Üí O ‚Üí not in t
* `j=3` ‚Üí B ‚Üí match B ‚Üí `need=2`
* `j=4` ‚Üí E ‚Üí not in t
* `j=5` ‚Üí C ‚Üí match C ‚Üí `need=3 == required`

‚úÖ Valid window = \[0...5] = "ADOBEC"

* Update `cnt=6`, `start=0`

Now start shrinking:

* `i=0` ‚Üí remove A ‚Üí now A freq drops ‚Üí `need=2`
* Expand again...

Eventually,

* Best window = \[9...12] = `"BANC"`

---

## ‚úÖ Final Output:

```cpp
return s.substr(start, cnt);  // "BANC"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Time & Space Complexity

### ‚è± Time Complexity:

* O(|s| + |t|), since each character is processed at most twice (once by `j`, once by `i`)

### üß† Space Complexity:

* O(|t|), for `freq1` and `window` maps (since only characters from `t` matter)

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature       | Details                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Technique     | Sliding Window + Hash Map      |
| Best Use Case | Substring with character freq  |
| Time          | O(n + m)                       |
| Space         | O(m)                           |
| Input Example | s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC" |
| Output        | `"BANC"`                       |

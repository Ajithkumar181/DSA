Got it 👍 Let’s make **revision notes** for your `decodeString` problem so you can quickly revise before interviews or practice.

# 📝 Revision Notes – Decode String Problem

### **Problem Statement**

You are given an **encoded string** where:

* Integers represent the number of times a substring inside brackets `[]` should repeat.
* The task is to **decode** it into its original form.

**Example**:

* Input: `"3[a]2[bc]"`
* Output: `"aaabcbc"`

---

### **Approach Used in Code**

1. **Data Structures**

   * `stack<int> stNum` → Stores repeat counts (numbers before `[`).
   * `stack<string> stChar` → Stores previously accumulated strings before entering a bracket.

2. **Tracking Variables**

   * `cur` → Holds the current substring being built.
   * `digit` → Holds digits (since numbers may have multiple digits, e.g., `"12[a]"`).

---

### **Step-by-Step Logic**

1. **Traverse string `s` character by character**:

   * If **alphabet** → Append to `cur`.
   * If **digit** → Accumulate in `digit` (to handle multi-digit numbers).
   * If `'['` →

     * Push `cur` to `stChar` (save previous string).
     * Push `stoi(digit)` to `stNum` (repeat count).
     * Reset `cur` and `digit`.
   * If `']'` →

     * Pop `freq` from `stNum`.
     * Repeat current string `cur` → `res`.
     * Pop top from `stChar` and append with `res` to form new `cur`.

2. **Return final `cur` after loop ends**.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**

* Use stacks because decoding requires **last opened bracket to be closed first** → LIFO order.
* Always **reset `cur` and `digit`** when starting fresh after `'['`.
* Multi-digit numbers must be handled (`stoi(digit)`).
* Time complexity → **O(n \* k)** where `k` is max repeat count.
* Space complexity → **O(n)** due to stacks.

---

### **Dry Run Example**

Input: `"3[a2[c]]"`

* `3[` → Push `3`, push `""`.
* `a` → cur = `"a"`.
* `2[` → Push `2`, push `"a"`. cur = `""`.
* `c` → cur = `"c"`.
* `]` → Pop 2 → `"cc"`. Prev = `"a"`. cur = `"acc"`.
* `]` → Pop 3 → `"accaccacc"`. Prev = `""`. cur = `"accaccacc"`.

Output = `"accaccacc"` ✅

👉 This is one of the **classic stack-based problems** that combines **string building + stack usage**.

Do you want me to also make a **list of common test cases** (including tricky ones like nested brackets, empty string, or multi-digit repeats) so you can test your code properly?

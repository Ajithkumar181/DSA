Got it 👍 Let’s break this problem into **revision notes** (concept recap + approach) and then do a **dry run** on an example input.

## 📘 Revision Notes: *Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid*

### 🔹 Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing only `'('` and `')'`, find the **minimum number of parentheses we must add** to make it a valid parentheses string.

A valid parentheses string:

* Every `'('` must have a matching `')'`.
* Every `')'` must have a matching `'('`.

---

### 🔹 Key Idea

We maintain two counters:

1. `open` → tracks **unmatched `'('`** (waiting to be closed).
2. `close` → tracks **unmatched `')'`** (need extra `'('` before them).

At the end, the result is `open + close`:

* `open` → number of extra `')'` needed.
* `close` → number of extra `'('` needed.

---

### 🔹 Algorithm

1. Initialize `open = 0, close = 0`.
2. Traverse each character `c` in string:

   * If `c == '(' → open++`
   * Else if `c == ')' and open > 0 → open--` (match with a previous `'('`)
   * Else if `c == ')' and open == 0 → close++` (no `'('` available → need one extra)
3. Return `open + close`.

### 🔹 Time & Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) (one pass through string).
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (just two counters).

## 📝 Dry Run Example

### Example 1

`s = "())"`

* Start: `open=0, close=0`
* `'('` → open=1, close=0
* `')'` → open=0 (matched with one `'('`)
* `')'` → open=0, but no `'('` → close=1

**Result = open + close = 0 + 1 = 1** ✅

---

### Example 2

`s = "((("`

* `'('` → open=1
* `'('` → open=2
* `'('` → open=3

**Result = open + close = 3 + 0 = 3** (need 3 closing brackets). ✅

---

### Example 3

`s = "()))(("`

* `'('` → open=1
* `')'` → open=0 (matched)
* `')'` → open=0, no `'('` → close=1
* `')'` → open=0, no `'('` → close=2
* `'('` → open=1
* `'('` → open=2

**Result = open + close = 2 + 2 = 4** ✅

---

✨ **Takeaway:**

* Use counters instead of a stack → efficient.
* Formula is always `open + close`.

Would you like me to also show this with a **stack-based approach + dry run** (so you can compare both methods for revision)?

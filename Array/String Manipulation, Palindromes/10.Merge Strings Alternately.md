Here are the **revision notes with a dry run** for the given problem:

---

## ✅ Problem Statement

**"Merge Strings Alternately"**

> Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, merge them by alternating characters from each string.
> If one string is longer, append the remaining characters to the result.

---

## ✅ Example

```cpp
Input:  word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
```

Another example:

```cpp
Input:  word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
```

---

## ✅ Key Concepts

* Use **two pointers**: `i` for `word1`, `j` for `word2`
* Use a **result string** `res`
* In the first loop, add one character from each word alternately
* In the second and third loop, add remaining characters from the longer word (if any)

---

## ✅ Code Explanation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int n = word1.size(), m = word2.size();
        string res;

        while (i < n && j < m) {
            res += word1[i++];
            res += word2[j++];
        }
        while (i < n) {
            res += word1[i++];
        }
        while (j < m) {
            res += word2[j++];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## ✅ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric           | Value    |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(n + m) |
| Space Complexity | O(n + m) |

---

## ✅ Dry Run

### Input:

```cpp
word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqrs"
```

| Step | i | j | res      | Action                    |
| ---- | - | - | -------- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | 0 | 0 | ""       | res += 'a', res += 'p'    |
| 2    | 1 | 1 | "ap"     | res += 'b', res += 'q'    |
| 3    | 2 | 2 | "apbq"   | res += 'c', res += 'r'    |
| 4    | 3 | 3 | "apbqcr" | word1 done, word2 not yet |
| 5    | - | 3 | "apbqcr" | res += 's'                |

### Final Output:

```
"apbqcrs"
```

## ✅ Summary Table

| Concept                | Explanation                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Two-pointer loop       | Alternates between word1 and word2  |
| Handles unequal length | Remaining part is appended directly |
| Efficient              | Linear time and space complexity    |

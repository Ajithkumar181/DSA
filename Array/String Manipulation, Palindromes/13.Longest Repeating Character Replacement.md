# Revision Notes: Longest Repeating Character Replacement

### Problem Summary:

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest substring where you can replace at most `k` characters to make all characters in the substring the same.

---

### Code Explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);  // Frequency of each character in current window
        int i = 0;                // Left pointer of the sliding window
        int cnt = 0;              // Result: max length found
        int maxCnt = 0;           // Max frequency of a single character in the current window

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            freq[s[j] - 'A']++;                 // Add current char to window frequency
            maxCnt = max(maxCnt, freq[s[j] - 'A']);  // Update max frequency in window

            int window = j - i + 1;             // Current window size

            // If more than k characters need replacement, shrink window from left
            if (window - maxCnt > k) {
                freq[s[i] - 'A']--;            // Remove left char from freq count
                i++;                          // Shrink window
            }

            // Update max length after adjusting window
            cnt = max(cnt, j - i + 1);
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```

---

### Intuition:

* Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window with at most `k` characters replaced.
* Keep track of the most frequent character count in the current window (`maxCnt`).
* If the difference between the window size and `maxCnt` is more than `k`, shrink the window from the left.
* Always update the maximum window length (`cnt`).

### Dry Run:

Example:
`s = "AABABBA"`, `k = 1`

| Step | i (left) | j (right) | Window   | freq (A,B) | maxCnt | window size | window-maxCnt | Condition               | Action                                   | cnt (max length) |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | 0        | 0         | "A"      | A=1,B=0    | 1      | 1           | 0             | 1 ≤ k                   | Update cnt=1                             | 1                |

| 4    | 0        | 3         | "AABA"   | A=3,B=1    | 3      | 4           | 1             | 3 ≤ k                   | Update cnt=4                             | 4                |
| 5    | 0        | 4         | "AABAB"  | A=3,B=2    | 3      | 5           | 2             | 3 ≤ k                   | Update cnt=5                             | 5                |
| 6    | 0        | 5         | "AABABB" | A=3,B=3    | 3      | 6           | 3             | 3 > k (since 6-3=3 > 1) | Shrink window from left: i=1, freq\[A]-- | 5                |
| 7    | 1        | 5         | "ABABB"  | A=2,B=3    | 3      | 5           | 2             | 3 ≤ k                   | Update cnt=5                             | 5                |
| 8    | 1        | 6         | "ABABBA" | A=2,B=4    | 4      | 6           | 2             | 4 > k (6-4=2 > 1)       | Shrink window: i=2, freq\[A]--           | 5                |
| 9    | 2        | 6         | "BABBA"  | A=1,B=4    | 4      | 5           | 1             | 4 ≤ k                   | Update cnt=5                             | 5                |

**Result:** 5

---

### Time Complexity:

* **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string.
* Each character is visited at most twice: once when expanding `j` and once when shrinking `i`.

---

### Space Complexity:

* **O(1)** - Frequency array of size 26 for uppercase English letters, independent of input size.

# Revision Notes: Check if `s2` Contains Permutation of `s1`

---

### Problem Summary:

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, check if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1` as a substring.

---

### Approach Overview:

* Use a **sliding window** of length equal to `s1.size()` over `s2`.
* Keep frequency counts of characters in `s1` and in the current window of `s2`.
* Compare frequency arrays at each step to see if current window is a permutation.

---

### Code Explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkInclusion(string s1, string s2) {
        if (s1.size() > s2.size()) return false;

        vector<int> freq1(26, 0);  // frequency of chars in s1
        vector<int> freq2(26, 0);  // frequency of chars in current window of s2

        // Build frequency for s1
        for (char ch : s1) {
            freq1[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        // Initialize frequency for first window of s2
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); i++) {
            freq2[s2[i] - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check if first window is a permutation
        if (freq1 == freq2) return true;

        // Slide the window over s2
        int i = 0;  // left pointer of the window
        for (int j = s1.size(); j < s2.size(); j++) {
            freq2[s2[i] - 'a']--;    // remove char at left of window
            freq2[s2[j] - 'a']++;    // add new char at right of window
            i++;                     // move window forward

            // Check if window frequencies match s1 frequencies
            if (freq1 == freq2) return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

### Dry Run Example:

`s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidbaooo"`

| Step | Window Indices (i to j) | Window String | freq2 (a,b chars) | Check if freq1 == freq2 | Result      |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Init | 0 to 1                  | "ei"          | a=0,b=0           | No                      | Continue    |
| 1    | 1 to 2                  | "id"          | a=0,b=0           | No                      | Continue    |
| 2    | 2 to 3                  | "db"          | a=0,b=1           | No                      | Continue    |
| 3    | 3 to 4                  | "ba"          | a=1,b=1           | Yes                     | Return true |

---

### Time Complexity:

* Building frequency arrays: **O(m)** where m = length of `s1`.
* Sliding over `s2` with window size m: **O(n - m)** where n = length of `s2`.
* Comparing two frequency arrays each time: **O(26)** which is constant.
* Overall time complexity: **O(n)** linear.

---

### Space Complexity:

* Two frequency arrays of size 26 each → **O(1)** constant space.

---

### Summary:

* We use sliding window + frequency arrays to efficiently check permutations.
* We update the window frequency dynamically, avoiding recalculating from scratch.
* Comparing frequency arrays is cheap due to fixed alphabet size (26).

Great! Let's go over **Leetcode 122 ‚Äì Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II** ‚úÖ

---

## üîç **Problem Summary**

You are given an array `prices[]` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on day `i`.

You can buy and sell **multiple times**, but you **must sell the stock before buying again**.

### üéØ Goal:

Maximize your total profit.

---

## ‚úÖ **Key Insight**

To maximize profit when multiple transactions are allowed:

> **Add profit whenever there's a price rise** ‚Äî i.e.,
> if `prices[i] > prices[i - 1]`, then `profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]`.

This is like **collecting all upward trends**.

---

## üß† Intuition

* You buy at the bottom and sell at the top of every rise.
* But you **don‚Äôt need to track those explicitly** ‚Äî just add all positive differences.

## ‚úÖ **Dry Run**

Input: `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`

| Day                              | Price | Price‚Üë? | Profit |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 0‚Üí1                              | 7‚Üí1   | ‚ùå       | 0      |
| 1‚Üí2                              | 1‚Üí5   | ‚úÖ       | +4     |
| 2‚Üí3                              | 5‚Üí3   | ‚ùå       | 0      |
| 3‚Üí4                              | 3‚Üí6   | ‚úÖ       | +3     |
| 4‚Üí5                              | 6‚Üí4   | ‚ùå       | 0      |
| **Total Profit** = 4 + 3 = **7** |       |         |        |

## ‚úÖ **C++ Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

## ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

## üîÅ Related Pattern

This uses the **Greedy Strategy**:

> Take profit whenever you can.

## üîÑ Comparison with Stock I

| Feature                | Stock I (`121`)     | Stock II (`122`)          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| How many transactions? | Only 1 buy & 1 sell | Multiple (but no overlap) |
| Approach               | Prefix min + diff   | Add all rising diffs      |
| Pattern                | Prefix Min Tracking | Greedy Profit Collecting  |

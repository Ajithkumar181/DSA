## 📦 So What You Have Now Is:

| ✅ Covered                 | 💡 Pattern Name                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Classic Search          | Simple binary search on sorted arrays           |
| ✅ First/Last Occurrence   | Lower bound / upper bound problems              |
| ✅ Binary Search on Answer | Most important real-world optimization problems |
| ✅ Rotated Arrays          | Split logic binary search                       |
| ✅ Function Output         | Search over math functions, not arrays          |
| ✅ Infinite Array          | Boundary expansion + binary search              |
| ✅ 2D Matrix Search        | Binary search logic in matrix                   |
| ✅ Greedy + Binary Search  | Hybrid problems (common in hard-level)          |

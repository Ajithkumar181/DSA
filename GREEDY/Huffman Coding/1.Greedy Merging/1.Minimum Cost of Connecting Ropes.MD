Here's a concise and clear **revision note** for the **“Minimum Cost of Ropes”** problem from **GeeksforGeeks**:

## 🪢 **Minimum Cost of Ropes — Greedy + Min-Heap Pattern**

### ✅ **Problem Statement:**

Given an array of rope lengths, the task is to connect all the ropes into one rope **with minimum total cost**.
Every time you connect two ropes, the **cost is the sum of their lengths**.

---

### 🧠 **Core Idea (Greedy Strategy):**

* **Always combine the two smallest ropes first**.
* Use a **Min-Heap** to efficiently get the two smallest ropes at each step.
* This is an example of the **“Combine Two Minimums”** greedy pattern.

---

### 📦 **Data Structure Used:**

* **Min-Heap** (`priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`)

---

### ⚙️ **Algorithm Steps:**

1. Push all rope lengths into a min-heap.
2. While more than one rope remains:

   * Extract the two smallest ropes.
   * Connect them: `cost = rope1 + rope2`.
   * Add this cost to the total.
   * Push the combined rope back into the heap.
3. Return the total cost.

---

### 🧪 **Example:**

#### Input:

`arr[] = [4, 3, 2, 6]`

#### Steps:

* Combine 2 and 3 → cost = 5 → heap = \[4, 5, 6]
* Combine 4 and 5 → cost = 9 → heap = \[6, 9]
* Combine 6 and 9 → cost = 15 → heap = \[15]

#### ✅ Total cost = `5 + 9 + 15 = 29`

### 🧑‍💻 **C++ Code:**

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int minCost(vector<int> &arr) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int totalCost = 0;

    while (pq.size() > 1) {
        int r1 = pq.top(); pq.pop();
        int r2 = pq.top(); pq.pop();

        int merged = r1 + r2;
        totalCost += merged;
        pq.push(merged);
    }

    return totalCost;
}
```

### ⏱️ **Time & Space Complexity:**

| Metric    | Complexity                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | `O(N * log N)` due to heap operations |
| **Space** | `O(N)` for min-heap                   |

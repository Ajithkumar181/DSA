Here are **simple and complete lecture notes** on the **Huffman Encoding** problem from **GeeksforGeeks** — useful for both interviews and understanding the greedy + heap pattern.

## 📘 **Lecture Notes: Huffman Encoding**

---

### 🔷 **Problem Statement**

You are given a string `S` of **distinct characters** and an array `f[]` representing their respective frequencies.
Your task is to:

* Build a **Huffman Tree**
* Return the **Huffman Codes** in **preorder traversal**

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Minimize the total number of bits needed to encode the characters using **Huffman Coding**.

---

### 🧠 **Core Idea (Huffman Coding Algorithm)**

* It’s a **Greedy + Min-Heap based algorithm**.
* You **combine the two lowest frequency nodes** at each step.
* This forms a **binary tree** where each character has a **binary code** (0/1) depending on its path from root to leaf.

---

### 🧩 **Algorithm Steps**

1. **Create a Min-Heap** of all characters based on their frequencies.
2. While the heap has more than one node:

   * Remove the two nodes with the **lowest frequency**.
   * Create a new internal node:

     * Frequency = sum of the two.
     * Left = first node, Right = second node.
   * Push the new node back into the heap.
3. The remaining node is the **root of the Huffman Tree**.
4. **Traverse the tree**:

   * Left adds `'0'`
   * Right adds `'1'`
   * Leaf nodes contain the **Huffman codes** for the characters.

### 🧑‍💻 **Node Structure (C++)**

```cpp
struct Node {
    char ch;
    int freq;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    
    Node(char c, int f) {
        ch = c;
        freq = f;
        left = right = nullptr;
    }
};
```

---

### 📦 **Min-Heap Custom Comparator**

To ensure lowest frequency nodes come first, and for tie-breaking:

```cpp
struct Compare {
    bool operator()(Node* a, Node* b) {
        if (a->freq == b->freq)
            return a->ch > b->ch; // Tie-breaker based on input order
        return a->freq > b->freq;
    }
};
```

---

### 🔁 **Preorder Traversal for Codes**

```cpp
void preorder(Node* root, string path, vector<string>& res, unordered_map<char, int>& pos) {
    if (!root) return;

    if (!root->left && !root->right) {
        res[pos[root->ch]] = path;
        return;
    }

    preorder(root->left, path + "0", res, pos);
    preorder(root->right, path + "1", res, pos);
}
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Full Solution Function (Simplified)**

```cpp
vector<string> huffmanCodes(string S, vector<int> f, int N) {
    priority_queue<Node*, vector<Node*>, Compare> minHeap;
    unordered_map<char, int> pos;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        minHeap.push(new Node(S[i], f[i]));
        pos[S[i]] = i;
    }

    while (minHeap.size() > 1) {
        Node* left = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();
        Node* right = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();

        Node* merged = new Node('#', left->freq + right->freq);
        merged->left = left;
        merged->right = right;
        minHeap.push(merged);
    }

    vector<string> res(N);
    preorder(minHeap.top(), "", res, pos);
    return res;
}
```

### 📚 **Example**

#### Input:

```cpp
S = "abcdef"
f[] = {5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45}
```

#### Output (in Preorder):

```
0 100 101 1100 1101 111
```

Here are your **quick revision notes** for the problem **"Reorganize String" (Leetcode 767)**:

---

## 📘 Problem Statement:

> Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters so that **no two adjacent characters are the same**.
> If it’s not possible, return an empty string `""`.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts:

### ✅ 1. **Greedy Strategy**

* Always place the character with the **highest frequency**.
* Pair it with the **next most frequent** to avoid repetition.

### ✅ 2. **Max-Heap (Priority Queue)**

* Stores characters with their remaining frequencies.
* Always extract **top 2 frequent characters** to place alternately.

---

## ⚙️ Steps / Algorithm:

1. **Count frequencies** of all characters using a hashmap.
2. **Build a max-heap** of `{frequency, character}`.
3. **While heap size ≥ 2**:

   * Pop two most frequent characters.
   * Add both to result.
   * If count > 1, push them back with `count - 1`.
4. **If one character left**:

   * If its count > 1 → return `""` (not possible).
   * Else, append it to result.
5. **Return the result string**.

---

## 💻 Time and Space Complexity:

* **Time:** `O(n log k)`
  `n` = length of string, `k` = unique characters
* **Space:** `O(k)`
  for heap and frequency map

---

## 📌 Edge Case:

* If **any character frequency > (n+1)/2**, it's impossible to reorganize.

  > You can add this as an early check for optimization.

---

## ✅ Dry Run Example:

### Input: `"aaabb"`

**Frequencies:**
`a: 3, b: 2`

**Heap:**
`[(3, 'a'), (2, 'b')]`

**Process:**

* Pick `'a'` and `'b'` → res = "ab"
* `'a'` (2), `'b'` (1) → push back
* Pick `'a'` and `'b'` → res = "abab"
* `'a'` (1) left → push
* Pick `'a'` → res = "ababa"

✅ Output: `"ababa"` (valid, no adjacent same characters)

---

## 🧠 Important Variants:

1. **Rearrange String k Distance Apart**
   ➤ Same logic but keep a cooldown window of size `k`.

2. **Task Scheduler (LC 621)**
   ➤ Greedy with cooldown, very similar heap + queue logic.

---

## 🧪 Recommended Practice:

* LC 621. Task Scheduler
* LC 358. Rearrange String k Distance Apart
* LC 451. Sort Characters by Frequency
* LC 692. Top K Frequent Words

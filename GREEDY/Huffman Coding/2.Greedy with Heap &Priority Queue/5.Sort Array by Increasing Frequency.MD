## 📝 **Leetcode 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency**

### 🔹 **Problem Summary:**

Given an array `nums`, sort it in **increasing order of frequency**.
If two numbers have the **same frequency**, sort them by **decreasing numerical value**.

---

### ✅ **Example:**

```txt
Input:  nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]

- 3 → frequency 1
- 1 → frequency 2
- 2 → frequency 3
```

```txt
Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
(2 and 3 have same freq, so sort by value ↓)
```

### 🧠 **Approach 1: Using Map + Custom Sort**

1. **Count frequencies** using `unordered_map<int, int>`.
2. Use `std::sort()` with custom comparator:

   * Primary key: **frequency ascending**
   * Secondary key: **value descending**

#### 🔧 C++ Code:

```cpp
vector<int> frequencySort(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    for (int n : nums) freq[n]++;
    
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
        if (freq[a] == freq[b]) return a > b;     // value ↓ if same frequency
        return freq[a] < freq[b];                 // freq ↑
    });
    
    return nums;
}
```

#### ✅ Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`

#### ✅ Space Complexity: `O(n)` (for map and sort buffer)

---

### 🧠 **Approach 2: Min Heap**

1. Count frequencies.
2. Push `(frequency, -value)` to a min heap (to simulate descending value).
3. Pop elements and insert into result vector.

⚠️ Not optimal for sorting the whole array — better to use **sort** when full sorting is needed.

### 📌 Key Concepts:

| Concept                | Usage in Problem                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hash Map               | Count frequencies                        |
| Custom Sort Comparator | Sort based on frequency and value        |
| Lambda Functions       | Used in `std::sort` and `priority_queue` |
| STL Functions          | `sort()`, `unordered_map`, `vector`      |

---

### 🧪 Practice Tip:

* Try solving this using both `sort()` and `priority_queue` to solidify concepts.
* Also try **reversing the sort order** (e.g., sort by frequency ↓ and value ↑) as an exercise.

Sure! Here are **6 carefully chosen problem variants** that apply the **Greedy + Heap/Priority Queue** pattern, each with a slightly different twist — useful for interviews and deep understanding.

---

### ✅ **1. Reorganize String Variants**

**Problem:** Rearrange a string so that no two adjacent characters are the same.

**Variants:**

* **LC 767. Reorganize String**
  Rearrange such that no two same chars are adjacent.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *Rearrange string with k distance apart*

  > Same as above, but the **same character must be at least `k` distance apart** (cooldown).
  > ➤ Requires heap + queue.

---

### ✅ **2. Task Scheduler Variants**

**Problem:** Schedule tasks with cooldowns.

**Variants:**

* **LC 621. Task Scheduler**
  Greedy + max-heap + queue to handle cooldowns.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *Least time to finish all tasks with multiple CPUs*

  > Multiple processors working simultaneously.
  > ➤ Requires custom logic to simulate task assignment using **min-heap (time-based scheduling)**.

---

### ✅ **3. Top K Elements Variants**

**Problem:** Return the top K elements based on frequency, value, or distance.

**Variants:**

* **LC 347. Top K Frequent Elements**
  Max-heap on frequency.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *K Closest Points to Origin (LC 973)*
  ➤ Use **min/max-heap** on Euclidean distance.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *K Most Frequent Words (LC 692)*
  ➤ Heap based on frequency **and** lexicographic order.

---

### ✅ **4. Merge Files / Sticks**

**Problem:** Combine elements in a way that minimizes total cost.

**Variants:**

* **LC 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks**
  ➤ Use min-heap to always merge smallest 2 sticks.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *Optimal Merge Pattern* (GFG classic)
  ➤ Combine sorted files with min comparisons — same logic.

---

### ✅ **5. Frequency Sort**

**Problem:** Sort items based on frequency.

**Variants:**

* **LC 451. Sort Characters by Frequency**
  ➤ Max-heap on char count.

* 🔁 **Variant:** *Sort integers by frequency (LC 1636)*
  ➤ When frequencies are equal, use the **smaller number first**.

---

### ✅ **6. Running Median / Online Order**

**Problem:** Maintain running median or dynamic ordering.

**Variants:**

* **LC 295. Find Median from Data Stream**
  ➤ Two heaps: max-heap (left), min-heap (right).

* 🔁 **Variant:** *Sliding Window Median (LC 480)*
  ➤ Maintain median of current window using two heaps with erase support.

### 🧠 Summary Table

| Problem / Variant | Heap Type           | Greedy Decision                |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Reorganize String | Max-Heap            | Place most frequent char       |
| Task Scheduler    | Max-Heap + Queue    | Always schedule most freq task |
| Top K Frequent    | Min-Heap / Max-Heap | Keep top `k` items             |
| Connect Sticks    | Min-Heap            | Merge 2 smallest items         |
| Frequency Sort    | Max-Heap            | Place highest freq first       |
| Running Median    | Two Heaps           | Balance for online median      |

Great! Let's break down **Greedy Scheduling / Resource Allocation** and guide you through **how to learn and solve problems in this pattern**.

## 🔗 3. Greedy Scheduling / Resource Allocation

---

### ✅ **1. What Is This Pattern About?**

This pattern focuses on:

* **Assigning resources** (workers, machines, time slots, etc.)
* **Scheduling tasks** to **maximize profit**, **minimize cost**, or **use minimum resources**
* Often solved with **greedy algorithms** based on sorting or **priority queues (heaps)**

### 🛠️ **2. Core Greedy Strategy Steps**

| Step | Description                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | **Identify greedy choice:** What do you want to optimize (e.g., profit, time, cost)?  |
| 2️⃣  | **Sort data** based on this choice (e.g., decreasing profit, earliest deadline, etc.) |
| 3️⃣  | **Use data structures** like heap or array to assign resources/time slots efficiently |
| 4️⃣  | **Avoid conflicts:** Ensure resource/time is not double-booked                        |
| 5️⃣  | **Repeat until all jobs/tasks considered**                                            |

### 🧪 **3. Common Problems & Approach**

---

#### ✅ **A. Job Sequencing Problem**

**Goal:** Schedule jobs before their deadlines to maximize profit.

📌 Key Points:

* Each job takes 1 unit of time.
* You can schedule at most one job at a time.
* **Approach:**

  1. Sort jobs by **decreasing profit**
  2. Try to schedule each job **before its deadline**
  3. Use a time slot array to keep track of occupied slots

---

#### ✅ **B. Fractional Knapsack**

**Goal:** Maximize value in knapsack. You can take fractions of items.

📌 Key Points:

* Greedy works because we can take parts of an item.
* Sort items by **value/weight** ratio
* Take as much of the highest ratio item as possible

#### ✅ **C. Minimum Platforms / Meeting Rooms II**

**Goal:** Minimize number of resources (platforms/rooms) required to accommodate tasks without overlap.

📌 Key Points:

* Sort start and end times
* Use a **min-heap** to track ongoing tasks
* Allocate new room/platform if current overlaps

---

#### ✅ **D. Activity Selection**

**Goal:** Maximize the number of non-overlapping activities.

📌 Key Points:

* Sort by **end time**
* Always choose the earliest finishing activity that doesn't overlap

| 🟢 Easy   | Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack                            |
| 🟡 Medium | Job Sequencing Problem, Meeting Rooms II                           |
| 🔴 Hard   | Allocate minimum number of platforms, Minimum Cost to Hire Workers |

### 📌 **Helpful Tip:**

Greedy is **not always optimal**. Only use greedy if:

* The problem allows a **local optimal → global optimal** transition.
* There’s a **clear priority criteria** (like profit, cost, value/time).

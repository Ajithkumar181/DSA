## 🔥 MASTER LIST – DRYRIN + DRY RUN for Top 5 Problems

### 🔹 **1. Activity Selection Problem**

📌 [GFG Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activity-selection-problem-greedy-algo-1/)
📚 **Category:** Sorting-based Greedy

---

#### ✅ DRYRIN:

| Step               | Explanation                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D – Define         | Select **maximum number of non-overlapping activities** from given start and end times. |
| R – Requirements   | Only **one activity at a time**, can't overlap.                                         |
| Y – You Know       | Activities with **early end times** allow more scheduling.                              |
| R – Right Approach | 1. Sort by end time<br>2. Pick first activity<br>3. Skip overlapping ones               |
| I – Implement      |                                                                                         |

```cpp
sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
});
```

\| N – Note | Greedy by **earliest end time** is optimal here. |

---

#### 📊 Example Input:

```text
Activities: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (0,6), (5,9), (5,7), (8,9)]
```

---

#### 🧪 Dry Run:

| Step  | Picked? | Reason              |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------- |
| (1,3) | ✅       | First activity      |
| (2,4) | ❌       | Starts before 3     |
| (3,5) | ✅       | Starts after 3      |
| (0,6) | ❌       | Starts before 5     |
| (5,7) | ✅       | Starts after 5      |
| (5,9) | ❌       | Overlaps with (5,7) |
| (8,9) | ✅       | Starts after 7      |

✅ **Selected Activities:** **(1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (8,9)** → **Answer = 4**

### 🔹 **2. Job Sequencing Problem**

📌 [GFG Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/job-sequencing-problem/)
📚 **Category:** Deadline/Time Slot Scheduling

---

#### ✅ DRYRIN:

| Step               | Explanation                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D – Define         | Schedule jobs with deadlines to **maximize total profit**                          |
| R – Requirements   | Each job takes **1 unit of time**, must finish **before deadline**                 |
| Y – You Know       | Do **most profitable** jobs **first**, before their deadline                       |
| R – Right Approach | 1. Sort jobs by profit ↓<br>2. Try to schedule as late as possible before deadline |
| I – Implement      |                                                                                    |

```cpp
sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](Job a, Job b) {
    return a.profit > b.profit;
});
```

\| N – Note | Use array or DSU to track available time slots. |

---

#### 📊 Example Input:

```text
Jobs = [{id:A, deadline:2, profit:100}, {id:B, deadline:1, profit:19}, {id:C, deadline:2, profit:27}, {id:D, deadline:1, profit:25}, {id:E, deadline:3, profit:15}]
```

---

#### 🧪 Dry Run:

**Sorted by Profit:** A(100), C(27), D(25), B(19), E(15)
**Available Slots:** \[1, 2, 3]

| Job | Deadline | Slot Assigned | Total Profit  |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| A   | 2        | Slot 2        | 100           |
| C   | 2        | Slot 1        | 100 + 27      |
| D   | 1        | ❌             | (taken)       |
| B   | 1        | ❌             | (taken)       |
| E   | 3        | Slot 3        | +15 = **142** |

✅ **Answer: 3 Jobs**, **Total Profit = 142**

### 🔹 **3. Meeting Rooms II**

📌 [LeetCode 253](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)
📚 **Category:** Heap-based Resource Allocation

---

#### ✅ DRYRIN:

| Step               | Explanation                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D – Define         | Given meeting intervals, find **min number of rooms** needed to avoid conflict         |
| R – Requirements   | Meetings **can't overlap** in the same room                                            |
| Y – You Know       | Use **min-heap** to track end times of rooms                                           |
| R – Right Approach | 1. Sort by start time<br>2. Use min-heap to track end times<br>3. Pop if room frees up |
| I – Implement      |                                                                                        |

```cpp
priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
```

\| N – Note | Heap size = number of rooms needed at any time. |

---

#### 📊 Example Input:

```text
Meetings: [(0, 30), (5, 10), (15, 20)]
```

---

#### 🧪 Dry Run:

**Sorted by Start:** (0,30), (5,10), (15,20)

| Meeting | Heap (End Times) | Room Count |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| (0,30)  | \[30]            | 1          |
| (5,10)  | \[10,30]         | 2          |
| (15,20) | \[20,30]         | 2 ✅        |

✅ **Answer = 2 rooms**

### 🔹 **4. Fractional Knapsack**

📌 [GFG Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/)
📚 **Category:** Ratio/Value-based Allocation

---

#### ✅ DRYRIN:

| Step               | Explanation                                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D – Define         | Choose items to **maximize total value** under weight limit, **can take fractionally** |
| R – Requirements   | Can break items. Maximize value.                                                       |
| Y – You Know       | Sort items by **value/weight** ratio                                                   |
| R – Right Approach | 1. Sort items<br>2. Take full if fits, else take fraction                              |
| I – Implement      |                                                                                        |

```cpp
sort(items.begin(), items.end(), [](Item a, Item b) {
    return (double)a.value/a.weight > (double)b.value/b.weight;
});
```

\| N – Note | Greedy is **guaranteed optimal** since we can take fractions. |

---

#### 📊 Example Input:

```text
Items: [(60, 10), (100, 20), (120, 30)], W = 50
```

---

#### 🧪 Dry Run:

**Ratios:**
60/10 = 6
100/20 = 5
120/30 = 4

| Step          | Action   | W Left | Value              |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Take (60,10)  | Full     | 40     | 60                 |
| Take (100,20) | Full     | 20     | 160                |
| Take (120,30) | Take 2/3 | 0      | 160 + 80 = **240** |

✅ **Answer = 240**

#### ✅ DRYRIN:

| Step               | Explanation                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D – Define         | Schedule non-overlapping jobs with **max profit**                     |
| R – Requirements   | Must not overlap. Can skip jobs.                                      |
| Y – You Know       | Sort by end time. Use binary search to find last non-conflicting job. |
| R – Right Approach | 1. Sort by end<br>2. Use DP + binary search to get max profit         |
| I – Implement      |                                                                       |

```cpp
// Sort jobs by end, then DP[i] = max(DP[i-1], job[i].profit + DP[last_non_conflicting])
```

\| N – Note | Combine greedy + binary search + memoization. |

#### 📊 Example Input:

```text
Start = [1,2,3,3], End = [3,4,5,6], Profit = [50,10,40,70]
```

---

#### 🧪 Dry Run:

**Sorted by End Time:**
(1,3,50), (2,4,10), (3,5,40), (3,6,70)

DP Table (at each index `i`, max profit till job `i`):

| Job | Last Non-Conflict | DP\[i] = max(DP\[i-1], profit + DP\[last]) |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0   | —                 | 50                                         |
| 1   | —                 | max(50, 10) = 50                           |
| 2   | 0                 | max(50, 40 + 50) = 90                      |
| 3   | 0                 | max(90, 70 + 50) = 120                     |

✅ **Answer = 120**

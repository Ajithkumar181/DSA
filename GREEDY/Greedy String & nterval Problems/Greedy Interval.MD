Absolutely! Let's deep dive into the **Greedy Intervals Pattern** — one of the **most important greedy categories** in DSA and interviews.

## ✅ What is the **Greedy Intervals Pattern**?

**Interval-based problems** involve:

* **Start** and **end** times
* **Choosing intervals** based on some criteria (like max coverage, no overlap, etc.)

🔑 The goal is to **make optimal choices** using greedy strategies like:

* Sorting by **end time**
* Sorting by **start time**
* Sorting by **custom logic (duration, overlap, etc.)**

## 🧠 Key Techniques in Greedy Interval Problems

| Technique              | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sort by end time**   | Often used to pick the earliest finishing interval to leave room for others  |
| **Sort by start time** | Used when merging overlapping intervals                                      |
| **Greedy picking**     | Choose intervals that give best outcome (minimize deletions, maximize count) |
| **Custom comparator**  | Used when sorting needs to favor specific order (e.g., by length or ratio)   |

## 📚 Classic Greedy Interval Problems (With Explanation)

---

### 1. ✅ **Non-overlapping Intervals**

📘 Leetcode 435
🔑 **Goal:** Remove the minimum number of intervals so that no two overlap.

#### Greedy Strategy:

* **Sort by end time**
* Always pick the interval that ends earliest and skip overlapping ones

```cpp
bool comp(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
    return a[1] < b[1]; // sort by end time
}
```

### 2. ✅ **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**

📘 Leetcode 452
🔑 **Goal:** Shoot arrows to burst all balloons (each balloon is an interval)

#### Greedy Strategy:

* Same as above: sort by end
* Fire an arrow at the end of the first balloon
* Skip all overlapping balloons

---

### 3. ✅ **Merge Intervals**

📘 Leetcode 56
🔑 **Goal:** Merge all overlapping intervals into one.

#### Greedy Strategy:

* Sort by **start**
* Compare each interval's start with the current end and merge

---

### 4. ✅ **Meeting Rooms II**

📘 Leetcode 253
🔑 **Goal:** Find the minimum number of meeting rooms required.

#### Greedy Strategy:

* Sort intervals by start time
* Use a **min-heap** to track current meetings' end times

---

### 5. ✅ **Interval Scheduling Maximum** (Classic Algo Textbook Problem)

🔑 **Goal:** Pick **maximum number of non-overlapping intervals**

#### Greedy Strategy:

* Sort by end time (just like 435)
* Count how many intervals can be selected greedily

## 🧩 Pattern Summary Table

| Problem                         | Greedy Strategy       | What You Optimize      |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Non-overlapping Intervals (435) | Sort by end           | Max non-overlapping    |
| Burst Balloons (452)            | Sort by end           | Min arrows             |
| Merge Intervals (56)            | Sort by start         | Merge overlapping      |
| Meeting Rooms II (253)          | Min-heap on end times | Min rooms              |
| Interval Scheduling (Classic)   | Sort by end           | Max intervals selected |

## 🔁 Common Sorting Strategies

| Sort Criteria     | Use When                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `end ascending`   | To greedily fit more non-overlapping intervals |
| `start ascending` | To handle merging or grouping intervals        |
| `duration`        | When you need to pick shortest first (rare)    |

## ✅ Time Complexities

Most greedy interval problems:

* Sorting: `O(n log n)`
* One pass scan: `O(n)`
* Total: **`O(n log n)`**

## 📌 Tips to Master Greedy Interval Pattern

1. ✍️ **Draw timelines** — visually map start & end points.
2. 🔃 **Sort wisely** — most solutions depend on a good sort strategy.
3. 🧠 **Greedy doesn’t always work** — prove your strategy by contradiction or simulation.
4. 🧪 **Try variants** — like minimizing overlaps, maximizing coverage, etc.

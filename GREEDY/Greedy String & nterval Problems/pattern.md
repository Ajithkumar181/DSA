Absolutely! Let’s focus on mastering the **Greedy String Pattern** — an important and interesting sub-pattern in greedy algorithms.

## ✅ **What is Greedy String Pattern?**

In **Greedy String Problems**, the goal is often to:

* Build the **lexicographically smallest/largest** string,
* **Minimize operations** like deletions or swaps,
* Ensure **uniqueness** of characters,
* or **preserve order** while making a greedy choice at each step.

These problems usually require:

* **Character frequency counting**
* **Stacks** or **Greedy decisions on characters**
* **Greedy pruning** (removing unnecessary characters)

## ✅ **Key Techniques in Greedy String Pattern**

| Technique                 | Description                                    | Used in              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Stack for building result | Helps in removing/adding characters            | Leetcode 316         |
| Last occurrence tracking  | To know if we can safely remove a character    | Leetcode 316         |
| Frequency count           | To know if more of a character is coming later | Leetcode 402         |
| Lexicographic comparison  | To decide greedy choice of characters          | Many string problems |

## 🧠 **Top Problems with Dryrun Variants**

---

### 1. ✅ **Remove Duplicate Letters** (Leetcode 316)

**Goal:** Remove duplicates to get the **smallest lex string** where all letters are present once.

#### 🔑 Greedy Idea:

* If current char is **smaller than top of stack**, and the top **occurs later again**, pop it.

📘 [Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)

---

### 2. ✅ **Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters** (Leetcode 1081)

**Same as** Leetcode 316 with different phrasing.

📘 [Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/)

---

### 3. ✅ **Remove K Digits** (Leetcode 402)

**Goal:** Remove `k` digits to get the **smallest number**.

#### 🔑 Greedy Idea:

* Remove digits from stack if current digit < top of stack and we still have `k` removals left.

📘 [Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/)

#### 👇 Example:

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
```

---

### 4. ✅ **Monotone Increasing Digits** (Leetcode 738)

**Goal:** Given a number `n`, return the **largest number <= n** with digits in increasing order.

#### 🔑 Greedy Idea:

* Traverse from right to left, **decrease left digit if right is smaller**, and make all digits after it `9`.

📘 [Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotone-increasing-digits/)

---

### 5. ✅ **Remove All Adjacent Duplicates** (Leetcode 1047 / 1209)

**Goal:** Remove adjacent duplicates (sometimes in `k` group).

#### 🔑 Greedy Idea:

* Use **stack** to track characters and their counts. Remove when count reaches `k`.

📘 [Link to Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

---

### 6. ✅ **Lexicographically Smallest Subsequence of size k** (Hard)

**Variation of** 316 + 402.

#### 🔑 Greedy + Stack + k Size Limit

## 🧩 **Common Patterns Across These Problems**

| Problem Type          | Key Tools                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Lexicographic string  | Stack + Last index tracking |
| String digit problems | Monotonic stack             |
| Duplicate removal     | Stack + Count or frequency  |

| Monotone Increasing Digits (738)        | Digit fix from right          | Medium      |
| Smallest Subsequence (1081)             | Same as 316                   | Medium      |
| Remove Adjacent Duplicates (1047, 1209) | Stack + Count                 | Easy-Medium |

## 📌 Tips to Master Greedy String Pattern

1. 💡 Understand **why** the greedy choice is optimal (prove by contradiction if needed).
2. 🧠 Use **stack** to simulate building the final string step by step.
3. 🔄 Use **maps or arrays** to track frequency and last positions.
4. 🛠 Try **dry runs** on short examples before coding.

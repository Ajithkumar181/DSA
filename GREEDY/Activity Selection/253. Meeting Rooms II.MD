Sure! Here's the **approach explanation** for your `minMeetingRooms` function:

## Approach: Two-Pointer Technique with Sorting (Greedy)

### Idea:

You want to find the **minimum number of rooms needed** so that all meetings can be scheduled without overlap.

### Steps:

1. **Sort both `start` and `end` times separately**:

   * Sorting `start` lets you process meetings in the order they begin.
   * Sorting `end` lets you know when meetings finish so rooms free up.

2. **Use two pointers `i` and `j`**:

   * `i` points to the current meeting‚Äôs start time.
   * `j` points to the earliest meeting that is finishing (from the sorted `end` array).

3. **Traverse both arrays simultaneously**:

   * If the current meeting (`start[i]`) starts **before** the earliest finishing meeting (`end[j]`), it means a new room is needed because the previous meeting hasn't finished yet.

     * Increment `rooms` (room count).
     * Update `maxRooms` if needed.
     * Move to the next meeting start (`i++`).
   * Otherwise, if the current meeting starts **after or at the same time** as the earliest finishing meeting:

     * The room of the earliest finishing meeting is now free.
     * Decrement `rooms` (room freed).
     * Move the `end` pointer to the next finishing meeting (`j++`).

4. **Continue until all meetings are processed**.

5. The maximum number of rooms used at any point (`maxRooms`) is your answer.

## Why This Works

* Sorting both arrays lets you linearly scan through the timeline of meetings.
* By comparing the next meeting's start with the earliest finishing meeting's end, you know if you need a new room or can reuse an existing one.
* This efficiently counts the **maximum concurrent meetings** which equals minimum rooms required.

## Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity                                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Time   | `O(n log n)` due to sorting                       |
| Space  | `O(1)` (or `O(n)` if you count the sorting space) |

Let me know if you want a dry-run example or a visualization!
Great! Here's a **dry-run** example for the `minMeetingRooms` problem using the two-pointer technique with sorted `start` and `end` arrays.

---

### üî¢ Input:

```text
meetings = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
```

---

### üîÑ Step 1: Extract and Sort Start and End Times

```text
start = [0, 5, 15]
end   = [10, 20, 30]
```

---

### üìä Variables:

* `rooms = 0`
* `maxRooms = 0`
* `i = 0` (pointer for start times)
* `j = 0` (pointer for end times)

---

### üîÅ Dry Run:

| Step | `start[i]` | `end[j]` | Action                        | `rooms` | `maxRooms` | `i` | `j` |
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| 1    | 0          | 10       | `0 < 10` ‚Üí need new room      | 1       | 1          | 1   | 0   |
| 2    | 5          | 10       | `5 < 10` ‚Üí need new room      | 2       | 2          | 2   | 0   |
| 3    | 15         | 10       | `15 >= 10` ‚Üí room freed (j++) | 2 ‚Üí 1   | 2          | 2   | 1   |
| 4    | 15         | 20       | `15 < 20` ‚Üí need new room     | 1 ‚Üí 2   | 2          | 3   | 1   |

---

### ‚úÖ Final Output:

* `maxRooms = 2` ‚Üí You need **2 rooms** to schedule all meetings without conflicts.

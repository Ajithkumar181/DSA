Great choice, AJITH! The **Activity Selection** problem is a **classic greedy algorithm** problem and helps you understand a key greedy pattern used in **interval scheduling** problems.

---

## ✅ Problem Statement (Summary)

You're given `n` activities with their start and end times. You need to select the **maximum number of activities** that **don’t overlap**.

> 🧠 **Goal:** Maximize the number of non-overlapping activities.

## 🎯 Greedy Pattern in Activity Selection

This follows the **Interval Scheduling Optimization Pattern**. Here's the core idea:

---

### 🔁 **Activity Selection Pattern Steps:**

1. **Sort** all activities by **ending time** (smallest first).
2. **Initialize** a variable to track the **last selected activity’s end time**.
3. **Iterate** through activities:

   * If the current activity’s start time is **after or equal to** the last end time,
   * **Select** the activity.
   * **Update** the last end time.

---

### ✅ Why Sort by End Time?

* Choosing the **earliest finishing** activity leaves room for more activities afterward.
* This is the **greedy choice** that leads to the **globally optimal** result.

---

## 💻 Example in C++ (Simple Version)

```cpp
bool comp(pair<int,int> a, pair<int,int> b) {
    return a.second < b.second; // sort by end time
}

int activitySelection(vector<pair<int,int>> &activities) {
    sort(activities.begin(), activities.end(), comp);
    int count = 1;
    int lastEnd = activities[0].second;

    for (int i = 1; i < activities.size(); i++) {
        if (activities[i].first >= lastEnd) {
            count++;
            lastEnd = activities[i].second;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

## 📊 Input/Output Example

### Input:

```
Start Times: [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
End Times:   [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
```

### Output:

```
Max Activities: 4
```

### Selected Activities:

* (1,2), (3,4), (5,7), (8,9)

## 🌟 Variants & Real-Time Applications

| Variant                                | Real World Analogy       | Greedy Insight                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum Number of Meetings in One Room | Conference scheduling    | Same greedy pattern (sort by end time)          |
| Minimum Number of Platforms            | Train station scheduling | Use separate counters for arrivals & departures |
| Can Attend All Meetings                | Calendar conflicts       | Check for overlaps instead of count             |
| Merge Intervals                        | Calendar merging         | Merge overlapping intervals                     |

## 📌 Takeaway Pattern Summary

### ✅ Pattern Name: **Greedy Interval Scheduling**

* Sort by end time
* Pick non-overlapping intervals greedily
* Used to **maximize count of tasks/events** without conflict

> **LeetCode 452 – Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**

---

## ✅ **🔁 Problem Summary**

Given `points[i] = [x_start, x_end]`, where each interval represents a **balloon** on a wall, find the **minimum number of arrows** needed to burst all balloons.

* An arrow shot at `x` will burst all balloons where `x_start ≤ x ≤ x_end`.

---

## 🧠 **Greedy Approach – Explained**

### 🎯 Idea:

> Use **as few arrows as possible** by **bursting multiple overlapping balloons** with a single arrow.

---

### ✅ Steps:

1. **Sort** all balloons by **ending coordinate** (`x_end`) in ascending order.
2. Initialize:

   * `cnt = 1` → first arrow needed
   * `end = points[0][1]` → place first arrow at end of the first balloon
3. Traverse from `i = 1` to `n-1`:

   * If `points[i][0] <= end` → balloon overlaps → no new arrow needed
   * Else → balloon does **not overlap** → shoot a **new arrow**, update `end = points[i][1]`
4. Return `cnt` → total arrows used

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });

        int cnt = 1; // at least one arrow needed
        int end = points[0][1];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                cnt++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
```

## 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Metric   | Value        | Explanation                         |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 🕒 Time  | `O(n log n)` | Sorting the intervals               |
| 📦 Space | `O(1)`       | No extra space used (in-place sort) |

---

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition

* ✅ **Greedy**
* ✅ **Interval Scheduling** (like Activity Selection)
* Sort by **end time** → make **locally optimal** choices to reach global optimum.

---

## 📌 Example

Input:

```
[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
```

Sorted:

```
[[1,6], [2,8], [7,12], [10,16]]
```

Arrow 1 at `6` → bursts `[1,6]`, `[2,8]`
Arrow 2 at `12` → bursts `[7,12]`, `[10,16]`

✅ Output: `2`

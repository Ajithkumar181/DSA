Sure, AJITH! Here's a **quick revision sheet** for **LeetCode 435. Non-overlapping Intervals**, including the **approach**, **time & space complexity**, and **key takeaways** to master this problem.

## 🧾 Problem Summaryhttps://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

You are given a list of intervals `intervals[i] = [start, end]`.

👉 Return the **minimum number of intervals to remove** so that the rest are **non-overlapping**.

✳️ **Note:** Intervals like `[1,2]` and `[2,3]` **do not overlap**.

---

## 🧠 Greedy Approach (Optimal)

### ✅ Step-by-Step Strategy:

1. **Sort** all intervals by their **ending time** (i.e., `interval[1]`).
2. Initialize:

   * `end` = `intervals[0][1]` (tracks end time of last non-overlapping interval)
   * `count` = 1 (number of non-overlapping intervals we can keep)
3. **Loop** through intervals:

   * If `interval[i][0] >= end`, it's non-overlapping → **keep it**, update `end`.
   * Else → it's overlapping → **skip it** (i.e., "remove" it)
4. Return `n - count` → intervals to remove.

## ✅ Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if (intervals.empty()) return 0;

        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];  // Sort by end time
        });

        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= end) {
                count++;
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }

        return intervals.size() - count;
    }
};
```

## 🧪 Example Dry Run

### Example: `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`

* After sorting by end: `[[1,2],[1,3],[2,3],[3,4]]`
* Select `[1,2]` → next `[1,3]` overlaps → skip
* Next `[2,3]` is fine → keep
* Next `[3,4]` is fine → keep
* Total kept = 3 → remove = `4 - 3 = 1`

✅ Output: `1`

## 🧩 Time and Space Complexity

| Metric   | Complexity   | Explanation                       |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 🕒 Time  | `O(n log n)` | Sorting intervals                 |
| 📦 Space | `O(1)`       | Constant space (no extra DS used) |

---

## 📚 Key Concepts to Remember

* Sort by **end time**, not start.
* Always try to **maximize non-overlapping intervals**.
* `n - count` gives the **minimum intervals to remove**.

---

## ✅ Use Case in Interviews

* **Asked by:** Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Bloomberg
* **Pattern:** Greedy + Interval Scheduling
* **Why it's important:** Tests your understanding of optimal substructure & local decisions.

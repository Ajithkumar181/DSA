Here are the structured notes for **Leetcode 502 ‚Äì IPO** using the **Fractional Knapsack-style greedy approach**:

---

## ‚úÖ Problem: IPO (Leetcode 502 - Hard)

You are given:

* `profits[i]`: profit from the i-th project
* `capital[i]`: minimum capital required to start the i-th project
* `k`: maximum number of projects you can complete
* `w`: initial capital

**Goal**: Select at most `k` distinct projects to **maximize your final capital**.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach: Greedy + Max Heap (Fractional Knapsack Style)

### üîç Observations:

* You can only start a project if your **current capital `w` ‚â• capital\[i]**
* From all the **affordable projects**, you should choose the one with **maximum profit**
* You repeat this process up to `k` times

This is similar to **Fractional Knapsack**, where we always pick the **most valuable item that fits**, except:

* You can't take **fractions**
* You don't spend capital (just need to **meet** the requirement)

---

### ü™ú Steps:

1. Pair each project as `{capital[i], profit[i]}`
2. Sort the projects by **capital required** in ascending order
3. Initialize a **max heap** (priority queue) to store profits
4. For up to `k` times:

   * Push all projects into the heap whose `capital[i] ‚â§ w`
   * If the heap is empty, break (no more doable projects)
   * Pop the highest profit from the heap and add it to your capital

---

## ‚úÖ Code Summary (C++):

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int w, vector<int>& profits, vector<int>& capital) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> projects;
        for (int i = 0; i < profits.size(); ++i)
            projects.push_back({capital[i], profits[i]});
        
        sort(projects.begin(), projects.end());
        priority_queue<int> maxProfitHeap;
        
        int i = 0;
        while (k--) {
            while (i < projects.size() && projects[i].first <= w)
                maxProfitHeap.push(projects[i++].second);
            
            if (maxProfitHeap.empty()) break;
            
            w += maxProfitHeap.top();
            maxProfitHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return w;
    }
};
```

## ‚è± Time Complexity:

* **O(n log n)** for sorting `projects`
* **O(n log k)** in worst case (each project pushed to max heap of size ‚â§ k)

### üîπ Total: `O(n log n + n log k)`

---

## üì¶ Space Complexity:

* **O(n)** to store project pairs
* **O(k)** for the max heap (up to `k` elements)

### üîπ Total: `O(n)`

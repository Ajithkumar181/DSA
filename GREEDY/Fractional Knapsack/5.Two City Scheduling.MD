Here are the **structured notes** for the problem **Two City Scheduling (Leetcode 1029)** based on your code:

---

## ‚úÖ Problem: Two City Scheduling (Leetcode 1029 ‚Äì Medium)

You are given a `costs` array where:

* `costs[i][0]` = cost to send person `i` to **City A**
* `costs[i][1]` = cost to send person `i` to **City B**

You must send **exactly `n/2` people to each city** (total people = `n`, even number), such that the **total cost is minimized**.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach: Greedy (Sort by Cost Difference)

### üîç Observations:

* For each person, if `cost[i][0] - cost[i][1]` is **very negative**, it's much cheaper to send them to **City A**
* If the difference is **very positive**, it's cheaper to send them to **City B**
* So, sort people based on the **difference in cost** between going to City A and City B

---

### ü™ú Steps:

1. For each person, calculate:

   ```
   diff = cost to City A - cost to City B
   ```
2. Store `{diff, index}` in a vector
3. Sort the vector in **increasing order** of difference:

   * First `n/2` people (most A-preferred) ‚Üí send to City A
   * Remaining `n/2` people ‚Üí send to City B
4. Calculate and return the total cost

---

## ‚úÖ Code Summary:

```cpp
int twoCitySchedCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
    vector<pair<int,int>> ratio;
    int n = costs.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int val = costs[i][0] - costs[i][1];  // Cost diff
        ratio.push_back({val, i});
    }

    sort(ratio.begin(), ratio.end());  // Sort by cost difference

    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        int idx = ratio[i].second;
        total += costs[idx][0];  // Send to City A
    }

    for (int i = n / 2; i < n; i++) {
        int idx = ratio[i].second;
        total += costs[idx][1];  // Send to City B
    }

    return total;
}
```

## üîÅ Dry Run Example:

Input:

```cpp
costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[50,50],[20,30]]
```

* Differences: `[-10, -170, 0, -10]`
* Sorted: `[1, 0, 3, 2]`
* Send persons 1 and 0 to A ‚Üí cost = 30 + 10
* Send persons 3 and 2 to B ‚Üí cost = 30 + 50

‚úÖ Total = 120

---

## ‚è± Time Complexity:

* **O(n log n)** for sorting the differences
* **O(n)** for calculating total cost

### üîπ Total: `O(n log n)`

---

## üì¶ Space Complexity:

* **O(n)** for the `ratio` vector

### üîπ Total: `O(n)`

Let me know if you want a version with **custom comparator**, or a **greedy inline sort** without extra storage!

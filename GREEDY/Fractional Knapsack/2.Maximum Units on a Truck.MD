Here are the **approach notes, time complexity, and space complexity** for the `mincostToHireWorkers` problem:

## üß† Problem: Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

You're given:

* `quality[i]`: the quality of the i-th worker
* `wage[i]`: the minimum wage the i-th worker expects

You must hire exactly `k` workers such that:

* All hired workers are paid based on the same **wage-to-quality ratio** (i.e., all salaries are in proportion to quality).
* Each worker gets **at least their expected wage**.

Return the **minimum total wage** needed to hire `k` workers.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach:

### üí° Key Observations:

* To pay all workers fairly and meet their wage expectations, all must be paid using a common `wage-to-quality ratio`.
* For worker `i`, their required minimum ratio is `wage[i] / quality[i]`.
* Once you pick a ratio (say, from a worker), you must **choose `k` workers with the lowest total quality** (to minimize cost) such that all their `wage[i]/quality[i] ‚â§ chosen_ratio`.

---

### ü™ú Steps:

1. **Calculate ratio for each worker**: `ratio = wage[i] / quality[i]`
2. **Sort** all workers by ratio (ascending).
3. Use a **max-heap** to maintain the `k` smallest quality values:

   * Push current worker‚Äôs quality into the heap.
   * If heap size > `k`, remove the largest quality.
4. If the heap size is exactly `k`, compute:

   ```
   cost = sum_of_k_smallest_qualities * current_ratio
   ```

   Update the minimum cost if this is smaller.

### üì¶ Data Structures Used:

* **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: to track largest quality among current `k` workers
* **Vector of pairs**: to store `(ratio, index)` pairs

---

## ‚è± Time Complexity:

* **O(n log n)**: for sorting the workers based on ratio
* **O(n log k)**: for pushing/popping from heap (each of `n` workers is processed, each push/pop is log k)

**Total:** `O(n log n + n log k)`

---

## üßÆ Space Complexity:

* **O(n)**: for storing ratio and indices
* **O(k)**: for the heap storing up to `k` qualities

**Total:** `O(n)`

---

## üß™ Example:

```cpp
quality = [10, 20, 5]
wage = [70, 50, 30]
k = 2
```

* Ratios: \[7.0, 2.5, 6.0]
* Sorted: \[2.5 (index 1), 6.0 (index 2), 7.0 (index 0)]
* Try combinations:

  * {20, 5} with ratio 6.0 ‚Üí cost = (25 \* 6.0) = 150
  * {10, 5} with ratio 7.0 ‚Üí cost = (15 \* 7.0) = 105
* ‚úÖ Minimum cost = `105`

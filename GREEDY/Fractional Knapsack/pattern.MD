That's great! The **Fractional Knapsack** problem is a classic example of a greedy algorithm in action. Here's a complete breakdown to help you learn it clearly:

---

### ✅ **Problem Statement**

You are given:

* `n` items with:

  * `value[i]`: value of the ith item
  * `weight[i]`: weight of the ith item
* A knapsack with maximum capacity `W`

You can take **fractions** of items.
Your goal is to **maximize the total value** in the knapsack.

---

### 📌 **Greedy Strategy**

**Take the items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first.**

> Formula:
>
> $$
> \text{ratio}_i = \frac{\text{value}_i}{\text{weight}_i}
> $$

---

### 🧠 **Algorithm Steps**

1. **Calculate value/weight ratio** for each item.
2. **Sort items** by this ratio in descending order.
3. Iterate over sorted items:

   * If the item fits entirely in the knapsack, take it.
   * Else, take the fraction that fits and break.

---

### 🔍 **Example**

**Input**:

```text
values  = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
W = 50
```

**Steps**:

* Calculate ratios:

  * Item 1: 60/10 = 6
  * Item 2: 100/20 = 5
  * Item 3: 120/30 = 4
* Sort: Item1 > Item2 > Item3
* Start adding:

  * Take full Item1: weight = 10 → value = 60
  * Take full Item2: weight = 20 → value = 100 (total weight = 30)
  * Take 2/3 of Item3: weight = 20 → value = 80

**Output**:
Max value = `60 + 100 + 80 = 240`

### 🧑‍💻 **C++ Code**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Item {
    int value, weight;
};

bool cmp(Item a, Item b) {
    double r1 = (double)a.value / a.weight;
    double r2 = (double)b.value / b.weight;
    return r1 > r2;
}

double fractionalKnapsack(int W, Item arr[], int n) {
    sort(arr, arr + n, cmp);

    double totalValue = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n && W > 0; i++) {
        if (arr[i].weight <= W) {
            W -= arr[i].weight;
            totalValue += arr[i].value;
        } else {
            totalValue += arr[i].value * ((double)W / arr[i].weight);
            break;
        }
    }

    return totalValue;
}
```

### 📝 **Time Complexity**:

* Sorting: `O(n log n)`
* Iteration: `O(n)`
  ➡️ Total: `O(n log n)`

Here are the **well-structured notes** for your `maximumUnits` solution in the standard format:

## ‚úÖ Problem: Maximum Units on a Truck (Leetcode 1710)

You're given:

* A 2D vector `boxTypes`, where each `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes, unitsPerBox]`
* An integer `truckSize` (maximum number of boxes the truck can carry)

**Goal**: Choose boxes to **maximize total units** loaded on the truck without exceeding the truck's box capacity.

---

## ‚úÖ Approach:

### üî∏ Greedy Strategy:

1. **Sort `boxTypes`** in decreasing order of `unitsPerBox` (column `1`) to prioritize the most valuable boxes first.
2. Iterate over the sorted `boxTypes`:

   * If the truck can take all boxes of the current type, load them all.
   * Otherwise, load only as many as the truck can carry.
3. Add the total units accordingly and reduce the remaining truck size.
4. Stop when the truck is full (`truckSize == 0`).

### üîÅ Dry Run Example:

```cpp
boxTypes = {{1, 3}, {2, 2}, {3, 1}}, truckSize = 4
```

Sorted: `{{1, 3}, {2, 2}, {3, 1}}`

* Take 1 box of 3 ‚Üí total = 3, truckSize = 3
* Take 2 boxes of 2 ‚Üí total = 7, truckSize = 1
* Take 1 of 3 boxes of 1 ‚Üí total = 8, done

---

## üß† Time Complexity:

* **O(n log n)** for sorting `boxTypes` by `unitsPerBox`
* **O(n)** for iterating through the sorted list

**Total**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` = number of box types

---

## üì¶ Space Complexity:

* **O(1)** extra space (in-place sorting and constant variables)

---

## ‚úÖ Code Summary:

```cpp
sort(boxTypes.begin(), boxTypes.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
    return a[1] > b[1];  // Sort by units per box in descending order
});
```

Then greedily take as many boxes of each type as possible until the truck is full.

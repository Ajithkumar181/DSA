# 📘 Job Sequencing Problem — Greedy Approach Notes

### 🔹 Problem Statement:

Given `n` jobs with:

* `deadline[i]`: latest time to complete job `i`
* `profit[i]`: profit for completing job `i`

Each job takes **1 unit of time**, and **only one job can be scheduled at a time**.

👉 **Objective**:
Maximize the **number of jobs done** and **total profit**, such that jobs finish **before or on their deadline**.

---

## ✅ Greedy Approach:

### 🔸 Steps:

1. **Pair each job** as `(deadline, profit)`
2. **Sort jobs by profit** in **descending** order
3. For each job:

   * Try to place it in the **latest free time slot ≤ deadline**
   * If slot is free → assign the job
   * Else → skip

---

### 🧠 Why Greedy?

* We want the **most profitable jobs** to be completed
* Placing them at the **latest possible free slot** allows tighter-deadline jobs to fit earlier

## ⏱️ Time Complexity:

| Step                       | Complexity                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sorting jobs               | `O(n log n)`              |
| Slot assignment (naive)    | `O(n × maxDeadline)`      |
| Slot assignment (with DSU) | `O(n log n)` ✔️ efficient |

✅ Use **Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)** to find available time slot in `O(log n)` time.

---

## 🧮 Space Complexity:

| Element          | Complexity       |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Slot array       | `O(maxDeadline)` |
| DSU parent array | `O(maxDeadline)` |
| Job array        | `O(n)`           |

→ **Total space**: `O(n + maxDeadline)`

---

## 📌 Example:

```cpp
Input:
deadline = [4, 1, 1, 1]
profit   = [20, 10, 40, 30]

Sorted Jobs = [(1, 40), (1, 30), (4, 20), (1, 10)]

Result:
Jobs Done = 2
Max Profit = 60
```

---

## ✅ Final Takeaways

* Greedy is optimal because:

  * Profit is prioritized
  * Deadlines are respected
* DSU gives scalable performance
* Widely asked in companies like **Flipkart**, **Microsoft**, **Accolite**

Here's a **quick and effective revision note** for **LeetCode 621 – Task Scheduler** (Medium):

---

### 🧠 Problem Summary

You're given:

* A list of tasks `tasks[]`, where each task is a capital letter A-Z.
* An integer `n` representing the **cooling period** between **same tasks**.

📌 **Goal:** Return the **minimum number of intervals (CPU cycles)** needed to finish all tasks, including **idle** intervals if required.

---

### 🔍 Key Observations

1. **Same tasks must be at least `n` intervals apart.**
2. Most optimal scheduling:

   * Space out the task with **highest frequency** first.
   * Fill in other tasks or idle slots around it.

---

### 🧮 Intuition & Formula

1. Count **frequency** of each task.
2. Let `maxFreq` be the **maximum frequency** of any task.
3. Let `maxCount` be the **number of tasks** that appear `maxFreq` times.

### ✅ Formula:

$$
\text{Minimum Intervals} = \max\left( \text{tasks.size()},\ (maxFreq - 1) \times (n + 1) + maxCount \right)
$$

* `(maxFreq - 1)` → number of full blocks.
* `(n + 1)` → size of each block (`n` cooldown + 1 task).
* `+ maxCount` → last row to fill final maxFreq tasks.

### 🔧 Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2`

* `maxFreq = 3` (A and B)
* `maxCount = 2`
* Formula: `(3-1) * (2+1) + 2 = 2 * 3 + 2 = 8`

🔁 Sequence: `A → B → idle → A → B → idle → A → B`

✔️ Output: **8**

### 💻 C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (char task : tasks) {
            freq[task]++;
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq[task]);
        }
        
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (auto& [task, count] : freq) {
            if (count == maxFreq) maxCount++;
        }
        
        int partCount = maxFreq - 1;
        int partLength = n - (maxCount - 1);
        int emptySlots = partCount * partLength;
        int availableTasks = tasks.size() - (maxFreq * maxCount);
        int idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);
        
        return tasks.size() + idles;
    }
};
```

### ✅ Tips for Interviews

* Greedy strategy: Always prioritize the **most frequent** task.
* Don't simulate the actual sequence unless asked. Use math!
* Understand the logic behind `maxFreq` and `maxCount`.

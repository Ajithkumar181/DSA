## üß† LeetCode 1235: Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling

### ‚úÖ **Problem Summary**

You are given three arrays:

* `startTime[]`
* `endTime[]`
* `profit[]`

Each job `i` runs from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]` and gives `profit[i]`.

**Goal:** Choose a subset of non-overlapping jobs to maximize total profit.

> üîÅ If one job ends at time `X`, you can take the next job that starts **at** `X`.

---

### üß© **Approach**

#### 1. **Combine Jobs**

Use a `Job` struct/class:

```cpp
struct Job {
    int start, end, profit;
};
```

#### 2. **Sort Jobs**

Sort by `startTime` (or `endTime`) to help in binary searching the next non-overlapping job.

#### 3. **Binary Search**

For each job, use binary search to find the **next job that starts after current job ends**.

```cpp
int binarySearch(int endTime, vector<Job>& jobs, int low);
```

#### 4. **Recursive DP with Memoization**

For job `i`, you have 2 choices:

* **Pick job i**: Add its profit and jump to the next non-overlapping job.
* **Skip job i**: Try next job.

```cpp
int solve(int i, vector<Job>& jobs, vector<int>& dp);
```

#### 5. **Final Function**

Initialize the `Job[]` list, sort it, and call `solve(0)`.

---

### üßÆ Time and Space Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n log n)`
  (due to sorting and binary search for each of `n` jobs)
* **Space:** `O(n)` for `dp[]`

---

### üß™ Examples

#### Example 1:

```cpp
start = [1,2,3,3]
end   = [3,4,5,6]
profit= [50,10,40,70]
Output = 120 // jobs 1 and 4
```

#### Example 2:

```cpp
start = [1,2,3,4,6]
end   = [3,5,10,6,9]
profit= [20,20,100,70,60]
Output = 150 // jobs 1, 4, 5
```

### üìö Concepts Used

* Dynamic Programming
* Binary Search
* Sorting
* Greedy with DP

---

### üîÅ Tips for Solving

* Always sort jobs first.
* Use binary search to avoid linear scan for next job.
* Use `dp[i]` to store best profit from index `i` onward.

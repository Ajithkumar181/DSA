Here's a **revision note** for the `findPlatform` function:

### 🔁 **Revision Notes – Minimum Number of Platforms Required**

#### ✅ **Problem Statement**:

You are given arrival and departure times of trains. Find the **minimum number of platforms** needed at the railway station such that **no train waits**.

---

### 🚆 **Key Idea**:

* Sort **arrival** and **departure** times separately.
* Use **two pointers** to traverse both arrays.
* Maintain a counter for **current platforms in use** and update the **maximum** as needed.

---

### 🧠 **Algorithm**:

1. **Sort** the `arr[]` and `dep[]` arrays.
2. Initialize:

   * `i = 1` → pointer for arrival
   * `j = 0` → pointer for departure
   * `platform = 1` → current platforms in use
   * `maxi = 1` → max platforms needed at any time
3. **Loop until** `i < n && j < n`:

   * If `arr[i]` ≤ `dep[j]`:

     * New train arrives **before or at** another’s departure → **need more platform**
     * `platform++`, `i++`
   * Else:

     * A train has **departed before** the next arrives → **free a platform**
     * `platform--`, `j++`
   * Update `maxi = max(maxi, platform)`
4. Return `maxi`

---

### 🔍 **Why It Works**:

By sorting and sweeping through both events (arrival/departure), we simulate the timeline and track the number of platforms required in real-time.

---

### 📈 **Time Complexity**:

* `O(n log n)` – For sorting the arrival and departure arrays
* `O(n)` – For linear traversal

### 📦 **Space Complexity**:

* `O(1)` – No extra space (besides variables)

---

### 🧪 **Example**:

```cpp
arr[] = {900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800}
dep[] = {910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000}
```

Output: `3` platforms needed

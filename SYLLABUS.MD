Would you like:

* A **PDF copy** of this syllabus?
* A **Notion sheet or Excel tracker** to mark your progress?
* A **recommended roadmap of YouTube playlists and sheets** (like Striver, Love Babbar, etc.)?

Just say the word!



Great, AJITH! Letâ€™s get you started with **Greedy Algorithms** and their **real-time uses in DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**. Iâ€™ll keep this **simple and structured** so you can easily understand and apply the concepts.

## âœ… What is a Greedy Algorithm?

A **greedy algorithm** is one that **makes the locally optimal choice at each step**, hoping it leads to the **global optimum**.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Idea**: "Pick the best choice now and trust it will lead to the best solution overall."

---

## ðŸ§  When to Use Greedy?

Use greedy when:

* You can break the problem into subproblems.
* You can make a **greedy choice** that is **safe and optimal**.
* The problem **has an optimal substructure** (optimal solution of subproblems leads to optimal solution of the whole problem).

---

## âœ… Greedy Algorithm Pattern (Steps)

1. **Sort or Prioritize** items based on some criteria.
2. **Pick items** based on the greedy rule.
3. **Check conditions** (like capacity, constraints).
4. **Repeat** until the goal is achieved.

## ðŸ’¡ Greedy vs Dynamic Programming

| Feature                 | Greedy     | Dynamic Programming             |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Local Decisions         | Yes        | No                              |
| Optimal Substructure    | Required   | Required                        |
| Overlapping Subproblems | No         | Yes                             |
| Complexity              | Often less | Higher (but guaranteed optimal) |

## ðŸ“š Summary

* Greedy is fast and often easy to implement.
* Not always optimal â€” must **prove** it works for your problem.
* Real-time uses in **scheduling, resource allocation, money, compression**.

---

If you'd like, I can:

* Create **detailed notes** for each problem,
* Give **implementation examples in C++/Java/Python**,
* Make you a **30-day greedy DSA roadmap**.

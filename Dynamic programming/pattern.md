make it structure Perfect Ajith! ðŸ”¥ Youâ€™re at the right stageâ€”Dynamic Programming (DP) can feel overwhelming at first, but once you know the patterns, itâ€™s like solving puzzles with templates. Letâ€™s build your foundation step by step.

ðŸ§© DP Learning Roadmap with Patterns
Step 1: Basics (Must Know First)

Before patterns, be clear about:

Recursion (write brute force first)

Overlapping subproblems (same work repeated)

Optimal substructure (final answer = best of smaller answers)

Memoization vs Tabulation

ðŸš€ DP Patterns You Should Learn

Iâ€™ll give them in the exact order you should study:

1. Fibonacci / Linear DP (1D)

ðŸ‘‰ Problems that depend only on previous 1â€“2 states.
Examples:

Fibonacci

Climbing Stairs

House Robber
Pattern: dp[i] = f(dp[i-1], dp[i-2], â€¦)

2. Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm / Maximum Subarray

ðŸ‘‰ Optimizing over continuous subarrays.
Examples:

Maximum subarray sum

Maximum product subarray
Pattern: Keep track of "best ending here".

3. Subset / Knapsack Pattern

ðŸ‘‰ Choices: take or not take.
Examples:

0/1 Knapsack

Subset Sum

Partition Equal Subset Sum

Target Sum
Pattern: dp[i][j] = can we achieve sum j using first i elements?

4. Coin Change / Unbounded Knapsack

ðŸ‘‰ Multiple ways to form target.
Examples:

Coin Change (min coins, total ways)

Rod Cutting
Pattern: unbounded choices.

5. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Pattern

ðŸ‘‰ Comparing two sequences.
Examples:

LCS

Longest Common Substring

Edit Distance

Minimum Insertions/Deletions
Pattern: dp[i][j] = best answer for first i chars of A and j chars of B.

6. Matrix DP (2D Grid)

ðŸ‘‰ Moving in grids with constraints.
Examples:

Minimum Path Sum

Unique Paths

Cherry Pickup
Pattern: dp[i][j] = best path till (i, j)

7. Palindrome Substring DP

ðŸ‘‰ Substrings inside one string.
Examples:

Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Longest Palindromic Substring

Palindrome Partitioning
Pattern: Expand around substring s[iâ€¦j].

8. Interval DP

ðŸ‘‰ Divide and conquer over ranges.
Examples:

Matrix Chain Multiplication

Burst Balloons

Minimum Score Triangulation
Pattern: try all partitions in range [i, j].

9. DP on Trees / Graphs

ðŸ‘‰ Apply DP to structured data.
Examples:

Diameter of a Tree

Maximum Independent Set in Tree

DP on DAG (longest path, shortest path)
Pattern: Post-order traversal, combine children states.

10. Digit DP

ðŸ‘‰ Count numbers with constraints.
Examples:

Count numbers with digit sum

Count numbers without consecutive 1s
Pattern: dp[pos][tight][sum]

11. Bitmask DP

ðŸ‘‰ Used for subsets and permutations.
Examples:

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Count Hamiltonian paths

Minimum cost to cover set
Pattern: dp[mask][i]

ðŸŽ¯ Strategy to Learn

Start with Fibonacci â†’ Subset â†’ LCS â†’ Matrix DP

For each problem:
âœ… Write recursion â†’ memoization â†’ tabulation â†’ space optimize.

Move to advanced patterns (Interval, Bitmask, Digit DP).

âš¡Pro Tip: DP is like "Story Writing" â€“ first ask yourself:

State: What do I want to remember?

Transition: How to move from smaller to bigger?

Base Case: Where does it start?

Do you want me to make a structured problem list (LeetCode/GFG) for each pattern so you can practice step by step?

# 📘 Problem: Climbing Stairs (LeetCode 70)

You are climbing a staircase.

* Each time you can climb **1 step** or **2 steps**.
* Given `n`, find the **number of distinct ways** to reach the top.

---

## ✨ Code (Top-Down DP / Memoization)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int step, int n, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (step > n) return 0;        // overshoot → invalid path
        if (step == n) return 1;       // reached exactly → valid path
        if (dp[step] != -1) return dp[step]; // already solved
        
        return dp[step] = solve(step + 1, n, dp)   // take 1 step
                        + solve(step + 2, n, dp); // take 2 steps
    }

    int climbStairs(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n+1, -1);
        return solve(1, n, dp) + solve(2, n, dp); // start from step 1 or 2
    }
};
```

## 🔎 Dry Run (Example: `n = 3`)

We want ways to reach step `3`.

### Call Tree

* `climbStairs(3)` = `solve(1,3,dp) + solve(2,3,dp)`

#### 1. `solve(1,3)`

* \= `solve(2,3) + solve(3,3)`
* `solve(3,3) = 1` (reached top)

  → Now compute `solve(2,3)`

#### 2. `solve(2,3)`

* \= `solve(3,3) + solve(4,3)`
* `solve(3,3) = 1`
* `solve(4,3) = 0` (overshoot)
* So `solve(2,3) = 1`

→ Therefore `solve(1,3) = 1 (from solve(2)) + 1 (from solve(3)) = 2`

#### 3. `solve(2,3)` (again)

Already memoized = 1

→ So total: `climbStairs(3) = 2 + 1 = 3`

✅ Answer = 3

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity (TC)

* Without DP → Exponential `O(2^n)`
* With Memoization → Each step solved once → **O(n)**

---

## 💾 Space Complexity (SC)

* DP array → **O(n)**
* Recursion stack → **O(n)** (max depth)
* Total = **O(n)**

---

## ✅ Key Notes

1. This is exactly the **Fibonacci pattern**:
   `ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)`
2. Base cases:

   * Overshoot → `0`
   * Exact top → `1`
3. Multiple approaches possible:

   * **Memoization (your code)**
   * **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**
   * **Space Optimized (just 2 variables)**

⚡ Ajith, do you want me to also give the **Tabulation + Space Optimized code** (the one interviewers usually expect after memoization)?
